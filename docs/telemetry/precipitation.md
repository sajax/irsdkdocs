Precipitation at start/finish line

::: tip Developer Post
So here are the weather values were logging out right now, at least live, there are a few more in the session string. The precipitation one is probably what you want.
I'm not sure if that is an average precipitation across the whole track, or just at the start/finish line (in spite of the comment).
You can also look at the session string and just filter out any sessions that have rain enabled, there going to be inconsistent anyway.
