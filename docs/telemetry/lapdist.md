# LapDist <Badge text="float" />

::: tip Developer Post
For the lap distance, some tracks have an angled start/finish line that is not parallel to the track Crossing at the top or bottom of the s/f line will give you a different relative distance. That may cause you to jump from 95% to -4% or from 104% to 5% depending on the angle.
