# LapCompleted <Badge text="int" />

::: tip Release Notes
 A new telemetry item "LapCompleted" has been added which contains the number of laps completed by your car (Similar to "Lap" which contains your car's currently started lap). At a circuit event, "CarIdxLapCompleted" will always be 1 less than "CarIdxLap", since the finish line both finishes one lap and starts the next. But at the NÃ¼rburgring Tourist config, where the start and finish are separate, completing a lap does not start the next one.
