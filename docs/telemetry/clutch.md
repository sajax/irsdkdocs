# Clutch <Badge text="float" />

Clutch is a float value determined by the position of the clutch axis in the sim.

Unlike Throttle and Brake there is no equivilant ClutchRaw value.

::: tip Developer Post
 I don't remember putting in any code to support the raw clutch. There is a Throttle and ThrottleRaw pair of values (and Brake/BrakeRaw) with the raw version reflecting the pedal input and the regular form indicating how the throttle lever on the engine actually moved.
