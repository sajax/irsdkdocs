# TrackTemp <Badge text="int" /> <Badge text="Deprecated" type="error"/>


::: tip Developer Post
 Dan reached out to me and mentioned that the TrackTemp variable is actually reading a value we don't use internally. So I have set it to the same value as TrackTempCrew and marked it as deprecated. We won't remove the value, but it no longer relates to the start/finish line.
